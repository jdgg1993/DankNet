# Training Model

### 1. Setup

1. Before we begin, make sure you've downloaded the [`dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/sayangoswami/reddit-memes-dataset/downloads/reddit-memes-dataset.zip/3) and you have python 3.6, pip and pipenv installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repo and inside `1. Training` run the command `pipenv install`. This will setup an environment for you with everything we need to get started.
3. Once everything is done setting up, activate your environment by using `pipenv shell`.
